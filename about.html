            <h2>Here's me Answering that Question years ago when I'm still 11th grade</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Why is this created?</strong> <br>
                Well because this a Performance Task and I chose an Image gallery because it's what I have in mind, I can't think of any
                topics on making a presentation, on a podcast, don't want to make a vlog for reasons, and a webcast is an I don't know
                so that lead to this.

        <div class="originalAbout">
            <h2>And Here's the reason why I revamped it now</h2>
            <p>Idk got bored, plus new pictures, and actual good features like not having 10k pages just for each picture</p>
